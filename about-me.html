<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hey there! I'm AyJeeBee, an aspiring full stack developer whos really into web technologies. The changing and exciting world of web development caught my attention. I've been, on a dedicated learning journey ever since.</p>

<p>Now I'm focusing on honing my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front end. On the back end side of things I'm diving into Node.js and MongoDB. To keep up with the times I've started exploring frameworks and libraries like React and Express.js. My goal is to use them in my projects as I continue to grow my skillset.</p>
    
<p>It's not only about the technical stuff for me. Its also about having a problem solving mindset. Every coding challenge is an opportunity for me to learn something. I'm always on the lookout for efficient and innovative solutions. Collaboration is key too. I'm excited about connecting with developers to share our experiences and grow together.</p>
    
<p>When I'm not immersed in studying you can find me keeping up with the tech trends or getting involved in open source projects. Oh. Don't forget that I love attending coding meetups! If you're interested, in exchanging insights or collaborating on beginner level projects or just talking about all things tech related as it keeps evolving lets connect!
